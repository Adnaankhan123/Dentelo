# Dentelo 🦷

Dentelo is a sample website project I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s not a real service — just a demo of how a dental hospital’s website could look like.

## 💡 About the Project

This project shows a basic layout for a dental clinic website. It includes pages and sections where users can:

- See details about the hospital (Dentelo)
- Read about available dental services
- View profiles of doctors
- Check an appointment booking form (not connected to any backend)

I made this project mainly to practice frontend development and improve my skills in building responsive and clean-looking websites.
